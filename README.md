  Obstacle avoidance is one of the features that is needed for the automated mobile robots. In older systems only one sensor is used to detect the obstacle. While using only one sensor the direction of robot will be moved either to left or right randomly. In our proposed model we are going to use Ultrasonic and Infrared sensors to detect the obstacle. The ultrasonic sensor is employed for proximity measurement, allowing the robot to detect obstacles within its immediate vicinity. Simultaneously, an infrared sensor provides additional obstacle detection capabilities, enhancing the system's responsiveness. Furthermore, the integration of a camera enhances the robot's perception capabilities, enabling it to visually identify obstacle. The robot's decision-making process involves evaluating data from both sensors. After detecting the obstacle robot automatically changes its direction in order to avoid the obstacle. Finally, we are going to construct a robot with obstacle detection and avoidance feature.
